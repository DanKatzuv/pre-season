"""A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. For example, do_twice is a function
that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:
def do_twice(f):
    f()
    f()
Hereâ€™s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice.
def print_spam():
    print('spam')
do_twice(print_spam)

1. Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a value, and calls the function twice, passing
the value as an argument.
2. Copy the definition of print_sum from earlier chapter to your script.
3. Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 2 as an argument.
4. Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and calls the function four times,
passing the value as a parameter. There should be only two statements in the body of this function, not four."""
